## Loading and preprocessing the data

Reading in the dataset from included .zip file from clone:

```{r}
activity <- read.csv(unz("activity.zip","activity.csv"), stringsAsFactors=FALSE, header=T, sep=",")

```

Aggregating steps by date:

```{r}
steps<-aggregate(steps ~ date, data=activity, sum)
````

## Histogram of steps
Using hist to graph a histogram of the number of steps:

```{r}
hist(steps$steps, main="Histogram of Steps", xlab="Steps")

```


## What is mean total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
mean(steps$steps)
```
## What is the median total number of steps taken per day?
```{r}
median(steps$steps)
```



## What is the average daily activity pattern?



## Imputing missing values



## Are there differences in activity patterns between weekdays and weekends?
